# Introduction #

Hello! I'm Mauricio Martins, technician in electronics and system analyst. During many years I was thinking how could brain waves control a computer. Despite of any technological difficulty I've been facing along the journing, I've been successfully started some research on this field.

I remember the days I presented in 1996 in my conclusion work for the university a proposal to develop such device. Well, it was a little bit ambitious at that time... also it rendered to myself the title of "mad cientist".

So, here it'll go...

# yaEEG #

Acronym for **y\*et**a\*nother EEG (ElectroEncephalogram). IF you look for this term in internet, of course you'll find tons of information. The most notable is **OpenEEG**.

Well, I found OpenEEG hard to implement. I decided to start one from myself. There are lot of information to be read, uh! Datasheets are uncountable... designs and calculations too.
